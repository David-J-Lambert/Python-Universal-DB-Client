IDM DB2 Sample Database
-----------------------
  - Does not exist yet.
  - For connecting to IBM DB2, my code uses the ibm_db library, which is
    available on PyPI.
  - The ibm_db library library requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14, which is
    available as "Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools" on
    http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools.
