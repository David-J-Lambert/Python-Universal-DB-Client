The 7-zipped virtual machine files are bigger than GitHub allows, so they're 
posted elsewhere.

I wish UbuntuSqlServer2017 was smaller, but most of this is Ubuntu Server and 
I don't know enough Linux to identify and remove unused packages and previous 
versions of kernels.  Surprisingly, the Ubuntu Server virtual machine 
has no desktop and the 2 turnkey virtual machines do.
