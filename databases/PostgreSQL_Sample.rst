PostgreSQL Sample Database
--------------------------
- Available at https://1drv.ms/u/s!AieKzIY33GmRgeAGzgQcIm-6gBO7CQ?e=hv7mnS.
- PostgreSQL 12.2.0-1 on an Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine running Debian
  9.12 Stretch, with LXDE desktop.
- This virtual machine is based on a virtual machine created by Bitnami, which
  was downloaded from https://bitnami.com/stack/postgresql/virtual-machine.
  Documentation for that virtual machine can be found at
  https://docs.bitnami.com/virtual-machine/infrastructure/postgresql.
- For connecting to PostgreSQL, this code requires the psycopg2 library, which
  is available on PyPI.
