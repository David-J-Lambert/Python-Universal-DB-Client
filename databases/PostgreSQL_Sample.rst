PostgreSQL Sample Database
--------------------------
  - Can be downloaded from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AieKzIY33GmRgcEwOQinckQ9Buyk9w.
  - PostgreSQL 9.4.19 on an Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine running Debian
    8.11 Jessie.  I've installed LXDE desktop 0.99.0-1 on it.
  - This virtual machine is based on a virtual machine created by Turnkey Linux
    (Turnkey GNU/Linux version 14.2), which is available at
    https://www.turnkeylinux.org/mysql.
  - For connecting to PostgreSQL, my code requires the psycopg2 library, which
    is available on PyPI.
