Oracle Sample Database
----------------------
  - Does not exist yet.
  - For connecting to Oracle, my code uses the cx_Oracle library, which is
    available on PyPI.
  - The cx_Oracle library requires the Oracle client libraries.  Several ways
    to obtain the Oracle client libraries are documented on
    https://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.
