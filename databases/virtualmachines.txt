The 7-zipped virtual machine files are bigger than GitHub allows, so they're 
posted online.

turnkey-mysql.7z (392 MB),
    

turnkey-postgresql.7z (393 MB),
    

UbuntuSqlServer2017.7z (848 MB),
    

I wish UbuntuSqlServer2017 was smaller, but most of the size is Ubuntu Server 
and I'm not a linux expert.  Surprisingly, the Ubuntu Server virtual machine 
has no desktop and the 2 turnkey virtual machines do.
