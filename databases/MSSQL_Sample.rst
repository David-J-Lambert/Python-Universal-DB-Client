Microsoft SQL Server Sample Database
------------------------------------
  - Can be downloaded from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AieKzIY33GmRgcQXIZ9mvqPNcEqHdw.
  - Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Express Edition on an Oracle VirtualBox virtual
    machine running Ubuntu 16.04.3 server.  No desktop environment, command
    line only.
  - This virtual machine was installed from a Ubuntu 16.04.3 server iso image
    downloaded from https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server.
  - For connecting to Microsoft SQL Server, my code uses the pymssql library,
    which is available on PyPI.
  - The pymssql library requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14, which is available as
    "Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools" on
    http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools.
