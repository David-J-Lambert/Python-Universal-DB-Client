MySQL Sample Database
---------------------
- Available at https://1drv.ms/u/s!AieKzIY33GmRgc1zW_xlX5Eeyqztug?e=YYeaTg.
- MySQL 5.5.60 on an Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine running Debian 8.11
  Jessie.  I've installed LXDE desktop 0.99.0-1 on it.
- This virtual machine is based on a virtual machine created by Turnkey Linux
  (Turnkey GNU/Linux version 14.2), available at
  https://www.turnkeylinux.org/mysql.
- For connecting to MySQL, my code uses the pymysql library, which is available
  on PyPI.
