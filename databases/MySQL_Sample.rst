MySQL Sample Database
---------------------
  - Can be downloaded from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AieKzIY33GmRgcExQPbjBZ62X4tPCQ.
  - MySQL 5.5.60 on an Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine running Debian 8.11
    Jessie.  I've installed LXDE desktop 0.99.0-1 on it.
  - This virtual machine is based on a virtual machine created by Turnkey Linux
    (Turnkey GNU/Linux version 14.2), which is available at
    https://www.turnkeylinux.org/mysql.
  - For connecting to MySQL, my code uses the pymysql library, which is
    available on PyPI.
